### Authors:
- Sanghun Kim
- Caleb Guan

### Files:
- Load.ipynb: This notebook loads the json files and exports them to the csv file. 
- Preprocessing.ipynb: This notebook performs data preprocessing from tokenization to lemmatization to language detection. Then, it saves the processed dataset. 
- Project.ipynb: This notebook takes the preprocessed data from Preprocessing.ipynb and performs feature engineering/analysis and as well as implements and evaluates our machine learning models. 
- Project.html: An html version of Project.ipynb. 
- Sample Project.ipynb: Our sample project notebook file to demonstrate some of our works. 
- sample.csv: It is our sample dataset which can be run in Sample Project.ipynb
- sgd_clf.pkl: Pickle file for our stochastic gradient decent classifier to be used in Sample Project.ipynb. 
- ldavis_prepared_initial_10, ldavis_prepared_initial_10.html: LDA visualization file. Includes intertopic distance map and relevant words.
- improved_cluster_tsne.png: Visualization of clusters generated by K-means clustering algorithm.
- topics.txt: List of topics for each cluster generated by the K-means clustering algorithm. 

### To grader:
Please download sample.csv, sgd_clf.pkl, topics.txt, and Sample Project.ipynb and run Sample Project.ipynb for a simple demonstartion of our work.
