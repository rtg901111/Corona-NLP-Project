### Files:
- Load.ipynb: This notebook loads the dataset and performs data preprocessing from tokenization to lemmatization to language detection. Then, it saves the processed dataset. 
- Project.ipynb: This notebook takes the preprocessed data from Load.ipynb and performs feature engineering/analysis and as well as implements and evaluates our machine learning models. 
- Project.html: An html version of Project.ipynb. 
- Sample Project.ipynb: Our sample project notebook file to demonstrate some of our works. 
- sample.csv: It is our sample dataset which can be run in Sample Project.ipynb
- ldavis_prepared_initial_10, ldavis_prepared_initial_10.html: LDA visualization file. Includes intertopic distance map and relevant words.
- improved_cluster_tsne.png: Visualization of clusters generated by K-means clustering algorithm.
- topics.txt: List of topics for each cluster generated by the K-means clustering algorithm. 

### To grader:
Please download sample.csv and Sample Project.ipynb and run Sample Project.ipynb for a simple demonstartion of our work.
